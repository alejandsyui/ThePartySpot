# Project Overview

Goal: Build a modern booking + live-event management site for The Party Spot (Trenton, NJ) with magic-link/Google auth, easy bookings, live session tracker, in-event request tiles, and notification channels.

Stakeholders: single Owner (your brother) who manages the site and venue operations, and party hosts (customers).

Success metrics: increase bookings, reduce manual coordination, improve on-site fulfillment speed, increase upsells (minibar, bathroom/utilities, catering, security guard).
