# User Personas

1) Host Hannah — books birthday parties for children; values simplicity and clear pricing.
2) Planner Paul — plans corporate events; cares about invoices, setup options, and reliability.
3) On-site helper Sam — a contractor/vendor who may fulfill requests (setup, cleanup, catering coordination); the single Owner manages assignments and the queue via the dashboard.

Action: flesh out contact details and scenarios after speaking with Owner.
