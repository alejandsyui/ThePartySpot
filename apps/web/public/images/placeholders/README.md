# Placeholder images

Store temporary stock photography here until The Party Spot uploads official venue assets.

Naming tips:
- kebab-case (e.g., `kids-birthday-balloons.jpg`).
- Include scene context, e.g., `corporate-mixer-toast.jpg`.
- Maintain source attribution in `docs/creative-brief.md` or a separate sheet.

When real photos are ready, replace these files and update any references in Astro/Svelte components.
